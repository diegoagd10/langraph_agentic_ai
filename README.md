# Langraph Agentic AI

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of LangGraph and LangChain to build agentic AI applications. Agentic AI refers to systems where AI agents can autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environment.

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with Large Language Models (LLMs), providing a graph-based framework for orchestrating complex workflows.

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models, offering components for chains, agents, and integrations.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd langraph_agentic_ai
   ```

2. Create a conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n venv python=3.12
   ```

3. Activate the conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate venv
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install the following packages:

   - `langchain`: Core framework for building LLM applications.
   - `langgraph`: Library for creating graph-based AI workflows.
   - `langchain-core`: Essential abstractions and utilities for LangChain.
   - `langchain-community`: Community-contributed integrations and components.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start building your agentic AI applications. Example code and usage will be added in future updates.
